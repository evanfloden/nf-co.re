## Financial  Support

Whilst much of the development work is done as a labour of love by those involved, we would specifically like to acknowledge and thank the following sponsors who help to support the project.

Please note that many other projects and grants list nf-core as collaborators and contribute to our community.

### Chan Zuckerberg Initiative {#czi-eoss}

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative runs a grant called [_Essential Open Source Software for Science_ (EOSS)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/).
Together with Nextflow, nf-core was supported in the second round of the CZI EOSS grant in 2020.

The CZI EOSS money has allowed us to hire dedicated personnel for development and community support at [QBiC](http://www.qbic.life/) and [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/).
It also funds expenses for event organisation and community tools.

### Amazon Web Services {#aws}

Amazon Web Services (AWS) kindly support nf-core with cloud compute credits to run each nf-core analysis pipeline with full-size benchmark datasets on every release.
You can explore and download these pipeline results under the <em class="mx-2"><i class="fab fa-aws mr-2"></i> Results</em> tab on each pipeline page.

AWS also hosts the [AWS-iGenomes](https://registry.opendata.aws/aws-igenomes/) resource on the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/).
This is used by most nf-core pipelines to give free and open access to the reference genomes of over 30 species, by using a simple `--genome` key when running a pipeline.

## History of nf-core

The nf-core project came about at the start of 2018. [Phil Ewels](http://phil.ewels.co.uk/) ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) was the head of the development facility at [NGI Stockholm](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) (National Genomics Infrastructure), part of [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/) in Sweden.

The NGI had been developing analysis pipelines for use with it's genomics data for several years and started using a set of standards for each pipeline created. This helped other people run the pipelines on their own systems; typically Swedish research groups at first, but later on other groups and core genomics facilities too such as [QBIC](http://qbic.life/) in Tübingen.

As the number of users and contributors grew, the pipelines began to outgrow the SciLifeLab and NGI branding. To try to open up the effort into a truly collaborative project, [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core) was created and all relevant pipelines moved to this new GitHub Organisation.

The early days of nf-core were greatly shaped by [Alex Peltzer](https://apeltzer.github.io/) ([@apeltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer/)), [Sven Fillinger](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/research-infrastructure/quantitative-biology-center-qbic/team0/sven-fillinger/) ([@sven1103](https://github.com/sven1103/)) and [Andreas Wilm](https://andreas-wilm.github.io/) ([@andreas-wilm](https://github.com/andreas-wilm/)).
Without them, the project would not exist.
